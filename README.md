##What It Is
---
This is a back-end task manager application made with JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Mongoose.js. It allows you to create
an account through the API and manage tasks that you can add, view, edit or delete. It was created with the main intention of building
a Node project with a NoSql database.

##What We Used
---
  * JavaScript
  * Node.js
  * Express
  * MongoDB
  * Mongoose.js


##Additional Dependancies
---
  * @sendgrid/mail - used to send welcome and cancellation emails
  * bcryptjs - used for hashing
  * jsonwebtoken - tokens used to authentication
  * multer - used for setting requirements for uploading avatars
  * sharp - used to resize avatars when saving to DB
  * validator - used to validate fields like email


##MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
---  
The main goal was to work with a NoSQL database and build a simple API that could be used for a task manager application. Users
can create accounts, login, logout, add and delete profile avatars as well as create and manage tasks they create. It completes
all of the main objectives and I feel confident building and maintaining a NoSQL database now.
  
  
##Future Features
---
  * A front-end UI so users can interact directly with the API.
